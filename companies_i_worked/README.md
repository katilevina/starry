# Companies I Worked Folder

**What goes here:** Companies you worked for — profiles built FROM your STARR achievements

---

## 🏢 What is a Company Profile?

A document that captures:
- **Company context** — Industry, size, business model, product/service
- **Your role** — Responsibilities, tools, team
- **Key achievements** — Compiled from your achievements
- **Web research findings** (optional) — Company events, launches, milestones during your tenure

**Key insight:** Company profiles are automatically built FROM your STARR achievements. You don't duplicate work!

## 🎯 Why This Folder Exists

1. **Company context for CVs** — Background for each position
2. **Organized by company** — All your achievements from one place linked together
3. **Auto-generated** — No manual entry of responsibilities/tools (from achievements!)

## 🚀 How to Add Companies

**Best way:** Add STARR achievements first, then:
```
/add-company
```

The system will:
1. ✅ Find all your achievements from this company
2. ✅ Extract responsibilities, tools, achievements automatically
3. ✅ Ask only for company context (industry, business model)
4. ✅ Create profile with source references: "*(from achievement_X)*"

**What if I don't have achievements yet?**
The system will encourage you to add achievements first. This ensures:
- ✅ No manual duplication
- ✅ Company profile always matches achievements
- ✅ Achievements remain source of truth

## 🌐 Web Research Feature

**What it does:**

During `/quick-setup`, after you provide employment dates for a company, I can optionally search online for:

- Company milestones during your tenure (funding, acquisitions, growth)
- Product launches and features
- News and market events
- Industry trends affecting the company

**Why it's useful:**

- ✅ Triggers memories: "Oh right, I worked on that launch!"
- ✅ Provides specific context for achievements
- ✅ Helps date achievements more accurately
- ✅ No manual effort — all automatic

**Example:**

You say: "I worked at Google from 2020-2023"

I find and add to your profile:
- "In 2020, Google launched Google Workspace"
- "Google reached 150,000 employees in 2021"
- "Launched Pixel 6 in 2021"

Then when adding achievements, I ask: *"Did you work on the Google Workspace launch in 2020?"*

**Opt-out:**

Web research is completely optional. You can skip it for any company (especially smaller companies with no online presence).

## 💡 Key Principle

**Achievements → Companies** (not the other way around)

- ✅ Achievements contain the details (what you actually did)
- ✅ Company profiles summarize those details
- ✅ When you add new achievements, company profile stays in sync

---

## 📊 When to Create Company Profiles

1. **After you have 2-3 achievements** from a company
2. **Before you start analyzing roles** (need company context)
3. **Anytime** you want to review your history at a company
