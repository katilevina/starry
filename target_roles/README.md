# Target Roles Folder

**What goes here:** Generalized roles you want — built from analyzing 20+ similar job postings

---

## 🎯 What is a Target Role?

**NOT a specific job posting!** A generalized role based on market analysis.

For example:
- **"Senior Product Manager in SaaS"** — built from 20+ similar PM job postings
- **"Data Analyst in Fintech"** — built from 15+ similar analyst postings
- **"Head of Growth at Series B Startups"** — built from 10+ similar growth lead postings

**Key insight:** One generalized role = One CV that fits multiple similar jobs!

## 📂 What's in a Target Role Folder?

Each target role folder contains 3 files:

1. **`role_profile.md`** — Market analysis from multiple JDs
   - Common requirements across all jobs
   - Priority keywords and skills (what appears most often?)
   - Market patterns and trends

2. **`skills_mapping.md`** — How your achievements match this generalized role
   - Which of your achievements demonstrate required skills?
   - What skills are missing?
   - Which achievements to include in CV?

3. **`cv.md`** — Tailored CV for this generalized role
   - Built from your best-matching achievements
   - Emphasizes keywords that appear across market
   - Every bullet has metrics

## 📊 Roles Index

**File:** `my_data/roles_index.md` — Market response tracking across all roles

**What it tracks:**
- Which roles generate the most employer interest
- Reply rates by role type (Project Manager, Specialist, Manager)
- Channel performance (personal referrals, referral links, company website)
- Top performing roles vs low performers
- Recommendations on which roles to prioritize

**When it updates:**
- When you create a new target role (via `/analyze-role`)
- When you submit an application (tracked in `applications_index.md`)
- When you receive a response (replied, rejected, interview, etc.)

**Template:** `roles_index_template.md` in this folder

## 💡 Key Insight

**Achievements are permanent, target roles are dynamic**

- ✅ Achievements = Your permanent career highlights (write once, keep forever)
- ✅ Companies worked = Your permanent work history (built from achievements)
- ⚡ Target Roles = Generalized roles based on market (add/remove anytime)
- ⚡ CVs = Generated per target role (one CV fits many similar jobs)

## 🔄 Workflow

```
1. Find 10-20 similar job postings
2. /analyze-role → creates generalized target role folder
3. /map-skills → matches achievements + generates ONE CV
4. Review CV, make edits if needed
5. Apply to ALL similar jobs with this ONE CV!
6. Repeat for different type of role (achievements stay constant)
```

**Result:** Instead of 20 CVs for 20 jobs, you have 2 CVs for 2 generalized roles.
