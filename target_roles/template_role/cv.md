> **⚠️ SYNC RULE:** This template must be kept in sync with `.claude/skills/skill_job_analysis.md`
> When updating this template, also update the skill file to keep them consistent.
>
> **Why both exist:**
> - Skill file (.claude/skills/) = primary source with theory + template
> - Folder template = backup for users without skills support
> - Commands use folder templates when skills aren't available
