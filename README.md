# Job Hunt System

> **A systematic, AI-driven framework to organize your career history and generate tailored CVs in minutes.**

**Status:** 🚧 Work in Progress | **Version:** 0.5 Alpha

Template for managing job search process with **STARR** stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection), employer context, and role-based CV generation.

**What this is:** A **file-first** knowledge system that works with any AI assistant — not a standalone program. Just copy the folder, open it in your AI agent, and start using commands.

***

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before using this system, you need:

* **Any AI assistant** with file access (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Kojori, etc.)
* **Basic AI literacy** — ability to open folders and chat with AI
* **Time investment** — 1-2 hours for initial setup, 10 min per subsequent CV

**What you DON'T need:**
* ❌ No coding skills required
* ❌ No Python/JavaScript installation
* ❌ No specific AI subscription (works with free and paid tiers)

***

## 🚀 Installation (Step 0)

**This is a file-first project — just copy and open!**

1. **Download or clone** this repository to your computer
2. **Open the folder** in your AI agent:
   * **Claude:** Create Project → Upload folder
   * **Cursor:** Open Folder
   * **Windsurf:** Open Workspace
   * **Kojori:** Open Workspace
   * **ChatGPT:** Upload files or paste `CLAUDE.md` as system prompt
3. **Start using commands:** Type `/quick-setup` to begin

**That's it!** The AI agent will read the structure and guide you through interactive workflows.

## 📁 Structure

```
job_hunt_2026/
├── achievements/         # YOUR achievements → written as STARR stories
├── companies_i_worked/   # WHERE you worked → company profiles built FROM your achievements
├── target_roles/         # WHAT you want to do next → generalized roles based on market analysis
└── .claude/commands/     # Interactive commands to automate the process
```

**Quick guide:**

* 📝 `achievements/` \= What you DID (your past achievements)
* 🏢 `companies_i_worked/` \= WHERE you did it (companies you worked for)
* 🎯 `target_roles/` \= What you WANT to do next (generalized roles, not specific job postings)
* 🤖 `commands/` \= Tools to connect it all together

***

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Quick setup (3-5 minutes) ⚡

```
/quick-setup
```

I'll quickly gather basic context about the companies where you've worked. This helps me ask better questions when you add achievements.

**Optional:** I can even search online for company information during your employment dates to find relevant events, product launches, and context!

**Result:** `companies_i_worked/company_[name].md` draft profiles created

***

### Step 2: Add your first STARR achievement

```
/add-achievement
```

Tell me about a work experience. I'll use the company context to ask specific questions and guide you through the STARR framework.

**Result:** `achievements/achievement_1.md` created with rich details

***

### Step 3: Add a few more achievements

Aim for 3-5 to start. Mix of:

* Recent achievements
* Different skills (leadership, technical, impact)
* Different companies/roles

***

### Step 4: Collect job postings for a target role

```
/analyze-role
```

Paste job descriptions from multiple similar jobs. I'll extract common requirements and build a generalized role profile.

**Result:** `target_roles/role_[name]/` folder created with analysis

***

### Step 5: Generate tailored CV

```
/map-skills
```

I'll match your achievements to the role requirements and create a CV.

**Result:** `target_roles/role_[name]/cv.md` — ready to use for multiple similar jobs!

***

**Total time:** First setup takes 1-2 hours. After that, each new CV takes 10 minutes.

***

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. Achievements Bank (what YOU did)

Collect your work experiences as **STARR** achievements ONCE:

* **S**ituation — Background and context
* **T**ask — What needed to be done
* **A**ction — What YOU specifically did
* **R**esult — Measurable outcomes with numbers
* **R**eflection — What you learned and what you'd do differently

**Why STARR?** Achievements are reusable building blocks. Write once, use for many CVs.

***

### 2. Companies Context (WHERE you did it)

For each company you worked for, the system automatically builds a profile:

* Extracted from your STARR achievements (no manual work!)
* Company overview (you provide: industry, business model)
* Your role, responsibilities, tools, achievements (from achievements)

**Key insight:** Company profiles are built FROM achievements, not separately.

***

### 3. Target Roles (what you WANT to do next)

**Important:** These are NOT specific job postings. They're generalized roles based on market analysis.

For example: "Senior Product Manager in SaaS" built from 20+ similar job descriptions.

For each target role:

* Collect multiple similar JDs
* Extract common requirements and patterns
* Identify priority keywords and skills
* Build ONE role profile that captures the essence

***

### 4. Skills Mapping (do you fit?)

Match your achievements to role requirements:

* See which required skills your achievements demonstrate
* Identify gaps (skills you need to develop or highlight)
* Tier achievements: Must-have vs nice-to-have for THIS role

***

### 5. CV Generation (tailored for each target role)

Generate a CV specifically for this generalized role:

* Uses only the most relevant achievements
* Emphasizes skills and keywords from the market analysis
* Every bullet has metrics from your achievements

**Result:** One CV that fits multiple similar jobs perfectly.

***

## 💡 What is STARR?

**STARR** is a framework for telling compelling stories about your experiences:

* **S**ituation \= What was happening? (Context, background, timeline)
* **T**ask \= What needed to be done? (Goal, problem to solve)
* **A**ction \= What did YOU do? (Your specific steps — focus on YOUR contribution)
* **R**esult \= What happened? (Measurable outcomes with NUMBERS)
* **R**eflection \= What did you learn? (Growth, what you'd do differently)

**Why STARR works:**

* ✅ Structured → Easy to write and read
* ✅ Quantified → Every story has metrics
* ✅ Reflective → Shows growth mindset
* ✅ Reusable → Same story works for different roles

**Example snippet:**

```
Situation: Our team made decisions based on gut feel...
Task: I needed to introduce data-driven processes...
Action: I built analytics dashboard, trained 3 teams, created weekly review...
Result: Decision speed improved by 40%, 3 teams adopted framework...
Reflection: I learned that change management is as important as the technical solution...
```

## 🔄 Before/After: STARR Transformation

**Before (vague input):**
> "I fixed a slow database query."

**After (STARR achievement):**
>
> **Situation:** Our e-commerce platform was experiencing slow checkout times. Customers were abandoning carts at a 35% rate during peak hours, and the database was maxing out at 100% CPU.
>
> **Task:** I needed to identify and optimize the bottleneck causing slow checkout performance.
>
> **Action:** I profiled the database and discovered a missing index on the `orders` table. I implemented a composite index on `customer_id` and `created_at`, rewrote the query to use the index, and set up monitoring to track query performance.
>
> **Result:** Checkout query time dropped from 2.1s to 0.4s (81% improvement). CPU usage during peak hours decreased from 100% to 45%. Cart abandonment rate dropped from 35% to 22% within 2 weeks.
>
> **Reflection:** I learned that systematic profiling beats guessing. Next time, I'll set up performance monitoring before issues become critical.

## 🎯 Core Principles

* **Facts only** — Never invent details. If you don't remember a metric, say so.
* **Metrics-driven** — Every claim should have a number when possible.
* **Reusable** — Write once, use for many CVs.
* **Gap-aware** — Know what skills you need to demonstrate before applying.
