# Job Analysis & Skills Mapping

This skill combines three related workflows:

1. **Job Description Analysis** — Extract and categorize requirements from JDs
2. **Skills Mapping** — Match achievements to role requirements with evidence
3. **CV Generation** — Create tailored resumes from skills mapping

## Part 1: Job Description Analysis

### Analysis Process

When analyzing a JD, extract systematically:

#### 1. Extract Responsibilities

- Copy the "what you'll do" section verbatim
- Identify 5-7 key responsibilities
- Look for emphasis patterns (bullets at top = more important)

#### 2. Extract Requirements

- Copy the "requirements" or "qualifications" section
- Separate into:
  - **Must-have** → "Must have", "Required", "X years experience"
  - **Nice-to-have** → "Preferred", "Strong plus", "Ideally"
  - **Bonus** → "Bonus", "Nice to have", "Plus"

#### 3. Keyword Extraction

**Technical terms:**
- Tools (Salesforce, Tableau, Jira)
- Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Lean)

**Action verbs:**
- led, launched, managed, optimized, drove, built

**Industry buzzwords:**
- Words that appear multiple times
- Terms specific to this industry/role

**Note:** These keywords should appear in your CV bullets

#### 4. Categorize Skills by Priority

For each skill found:

- **Critical:** "Must have", "Required", "X years experience"
- **High:** "Preferred", "Strong plus", "Ideally"
- **Medium:** "Bonus", "Nice to have", "Plus"

See [Role Profile Template](references/role_profile_template.md) for the complete JD analysis template.

## Part 2: Skills Mapping

### Mapping Logic

**Deep Achievement Analysis** (not just keyword matching):

1. Read the FULL achievement — Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection
2. Understand what YOU actually did
3. Extract how the achievement demonstrates specific skills required by the target role
4. Different skills can be extracted from the SAME achievement for different target roles

**Example:**
- Same achievement for "Data Analyst" role → demonstrates data analysis skills
- Same achievement for "Team Lead" role → demonstrates stakeholder management skills

**Evidence Quality:**
- Does the achievement have metrics?
- Is the impact clear?
- Is it relevant to the target role?

### Coverage Rating

- **✅ Strong:** Story has clear action + metrics directly showing skill
- **⚠️ Moderate:** Story implies skill or has weak metrics
- **❌ Gap:** No story demonstrates this skill

See [Skills Mapping Template](references/skills_mapping_template.md) for the complete mapping template.

## Part 3: CV Generation

### CV Strategy

**Prioritization:**
- Tier 1 achievements → Summary + top bullet points
- Tier 2 achievements → Work experience bullets
- Tier 3 → Only if space allows

**Tailoring:**
- Use target role's priority keywords in headers/bullets
- Reorder bullets by relevance to this target role
- Mirror market language (what appears across JDs)

**Principles:**
- Every bullet has a number/metric
- No more than 3-4 bullets per role
- Active voice, action verbs
- NO invented details

See [CV Template](references/cv_template.md) for the complete CV template.

### CV Generation Rules

#### Professional Summary
- 2-3 sentences max
- Mention target role title + years experience
- 2 key achievements from Tier 1 achievements with metrics
- 3 top skills from target role requirements

#### Work Experience Bullets
- Start with action verbs from JD
- Use Tier 1 achievements first, then Tier 2
- Every bullet must have a number
- Max 3-4 bullets per company
- Order by relevance to this target role (not chronology)

#### Skills Section
- Group by category (Technical, Leadership, etc.)
- Only list skills actually demonstrated in achievements
- Mirror JD terminology

#### What to Exclude
- Tier 3 achievements (unless space allows)
- Irrelevant experience
- Stories without metrics (flag these first)
